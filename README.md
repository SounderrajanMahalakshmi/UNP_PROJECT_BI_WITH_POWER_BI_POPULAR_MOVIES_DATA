# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_POPULAR_MOVIES_DATA
 
I did this project in collaboration with UMP. The Popular Movies Dashboard, a data-driven project that provides valuable insights into movie trends, audience preferences, and performance metrics. The dashboard analyzes the total number of movies, their genre distribution, and highlights the most popular and highest-rated films. It tracks key indicators such as average ratings, rating distribution, and user engagement levels, identifying which movies generate the most reviews. Additionally, it explores trends in popular tags and genres over time, offering a deeper understanding of shifting audience interests and thematic relevance. By examining patterns in ratings and user interactions, the dashboard helps uncover what resonates most with viewers. These insights are crucial for content creators, streaming platforms, and distributors to refine their offerings and improve audience engagement. The project serves as a powerful tool for understanding movie performance and guiding data-driven decision-making in the film industry.
